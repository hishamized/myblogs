      <h2>What is narcissism?</h2>
      <p>Narcissistic personality disorder (one of several types of personality disordes) is that people have a bloated sense of their own importance, unreasonable and excessive need for attention and admiration, problematic relationships and other issues. A mental state that has a lack of empathy. Narcissists generally strike a good impression around and look confident and charming in short term interactions but behind that mask of extreme self-confidence is a vulnerable self-sense that is vulnerable to slight criticism. 
         Narcissistic personality disorder causes problems in many areas of life, including relationships, work, school, and the economy. People with narcissistic personality disorders are generally unhappy and disappointed if they do not receive the special benefits and praises they believe are appropriate. They may find that their relationship is unfulfilled, and others hate being around them. 
         The treatment of narcissistic personality disorder focuses on talk therapy (psychotherapy).</p>

      <h2>10 Alrming Signs that a person is a narcissist</h2>
      <ol type="1" class="signs-narc-list">
         <li class="signs-narc-list-item"> 
            <h3>1) A superior sense of self combined with God complex</h3> 
            <p> Narcissists often have a sense of superiority. They feel that they are better than others and people somehow owe them everything that they want in life. These people think that they are the main character of a movie and everyone else is just playing a part in their life to complete their story. This is why narcissists always want to be the center of attention.  </p>
         </li>
         <li class="signs-narc-list-item">
            <h3>2) Excessive need for admiration</h3>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, narcissists are the center of their own universe and thus they need huge amounts of attention persistently to feed their ego and feel good about themselves</p>
         </li>
         <li class="signs-narc-list-item">
            <h3>3) Unreasonable Need for control and authoritarian behavior</h3>
            <p>Their rgo and superiority complex makes them think that they have the right to dictate everybody else how they should live their lives. This self entitlement makes them think that they are allowed to take decisions that in reality are not theirs to take. This is why dealing with narcissists can sometimes be a challenging task since you are always accussed for living your life freely since the narcissist feels challenged because of it. </p>
         </li>
         <li class="signs-narc-list-item">
            <h3>4) Identity Crisis</h3>
            <p>No matter how confident narcissists portray themselves, sooner or later their mask falls off and the weak insecure person is exposed. Deep inside these people are living in denial and if their ego is not satisfied and they dont get the admiration and attention that they so desperately need to feed themselves,  they panic and start losing control of themselves. </p>
         </li>
         <li class="signs-narc-list-item">
            <h3>5) Lack of responsibility and no accountablity </h3>
            <p>Narcissists want complete authority without taking any responsibility. If you engage in an argument with a narcissist they will quickly raise their voice and start yelling like an animal because they know that a reasonable discussion could expose them and hold them accountable for their actions. </p>
         </li>
         <li class="signs-narc-list-item">
            <h3>6) Lack of boundaries</h3>
            <p>A Narcissist believe that he/she is the only smart person in the room and everyone should agree with them and submit to their will. They often feel shocked when someone disagrees with them and launch their verbal and mental abuse towards that person in order to conquer them and feel good about themselves. Narcissists will interfere into every aspect of your life and violate your boundaries with their authoritarian mindset. However all this interference comes with absolutely zero responsibility. If something bad happens because of the decisions that they made for you (forcibly) then somehow it is still your fault and you will be blammed for it. Living and keeping up with a narcissist means compromising your freedom and submitting to their will. Anything you do in your life to which the narcissist diagrees with is seen as an attack on their God complex and thus they won't let you live the way you want and keep oppressing, opposing and abusing you until you give up.</p>
         </li>
         <li class="signs-narc-list-item">
            <h3>7) Excessive arrogance over small things</h3>
            <p>You can never tell a narcissist that they are wrong. Narcissists can keep yelling and screaming for hours to avoid accountability but even if you say one word against them, it will be blown out of proportion and you will be accussed for the crime committed by them. The fact that you disagree with them is seen as an open challenge to their superiority and they are convinced that you are the culprit for not agreeing with them and you need to be corrected and silenced. Telling them the truth is a threat to their God complex and you will have to suffer for bringing thr truth out in front of them.</p>
         </li>
         <li class="signs-narc-list-tem">
            <h3>8) Narcissists are the worst liars!</h3>
            <p>The public image of a narcisist is very dear to them and they usually would lie to any extent possible in order to protect this false demi god image that they think people have for them. Whenever their mask of confidence and charm is falling off leading to the real monsters in them being exposed, they lie and lie and lie to regain that image so that thet can feel good about themselves and when caught lying they will fabricate a series of lies to explain their previously told lies and gaslight you into feeling guilty for questioning them in the first place. Normal people indulge into arguments to establish what's true and what's false but narcissists argue to wear their victims down until the victim gives up because of exhaustion so that the narcissist can escape accountability.</p>
         </li>
         <li class="signs-narc-list-tem">
           <h3>9) Fake emotions</h3>
           <p>Narcissists fake anger when questioned about their behavior because a sensible argument would expose them. They create noise, start yelling and screaming to dodge responsibility.They fake hapiness to reflect how great their life is and how great they are. Narcissists even fake tears to bring all the attention to them and make people feel bad for them. They play the victim card to brush and accusse the victims of their abuse as the oppresor. A narcissist will keep provoking you until you have had enough. They bring out the worst in you. They force you to resort to your ugly side and play victim when you reach that point.</p>

        <p>The following content has been published to raise awareness about narcissistic abuse and help the victims recognise what they are dealing with. There are some aspects of domestic and social life which we don't talk about so often so I have come up with a small effort to start a conversation about a problem that has been prevalent in the society in almost every household.</p>
